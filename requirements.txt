1. Overview
1.1 Purpose
Develop a fun, engaging, web-based taekwondo fighting video game using Three.js to celebrate Evelyn’s 8th birthday on April 26, 2025. The game acts as a digital invitation and teaser for her birthday party at UMAC Briarcliff Taekwondo School, exciting her friends (aged 6-10) and building anticipation. It must be playable on both desktop web browsers and mobile devices, hosted online, and shared via a URL with parents of invited kids.

Secondary Users: Parents, who will share the game link and may supervise gameplay.
1.3 Platform
Web-based game running in:
Desktop browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge.
Mobile browsers: Chrome and Safari on iOS/Android smartphones and tablets.
Hosted at: https://<yourusername>.github.io/evelynstaekwondoshowdown/ using GitHub Pages.
1.4 Objective
Build a Street Fighter-style taekwondo fighting game with raw Three.js code (no external 3D models).
Include an animated introduction linking to Evelyn’s 8th birthday at UMAC Briarcliff.
Feature a single, simple taekwondo fight with basic controls and a win condition.
End with a “To Be Continued” message and party details to encourage attendance.
Ensure the game is lightweight, responsive, and easy to share via a URL.

Displayed in bold, white, Arial font with a black outline, centered on the screen.
Text fades in over 2 seconds, remains for 3 seconds, then fades out.
Visuals:
A 3D taekwondo character representing Evelyn, built with raw Three.js:
Body: THREE.CylinderGeometry(0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 8) (radiusTop, radiusBottom, height, radialSegments), colored white (0xffffff) for a gi.
Arms: Two THREE.CylinderGeometry(0.2, 0.2, 1, 8) attached to the body, angled outward, white.
Legs: Two THREE.CylinderGeometry(0.2, 0.2, 1, 8) below the body, white.
Belt: THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 0.1, 0.1) wrapped around the waist, colored black (0x000000).
Head: THREE.SphereGeometry(0.3, 8, 8) on top, colored beige (0xf5d7b2) for skin.
Animation: Evelyn performs a front kick—right leg rotates 45 degrees forward on the X-axis over 0.5 seconds, then back to neutral.
Background: Solid light blue (0x87ceeb) using scene.background.
Button:
“Start Fight” button, styled as a red rectangle (THREE.PlaneGeometry(2, 0.5)) with white text (“Start Fight” in Arial), centered below the character.
On click/tap, transition to the gameplay scene.
Sound (Optional): Upbeat 8-bit music loop (e.g., royalty-free chiptune from Free Music Archive), played via THREE.Audio if implemented.
2.2 Gameplay (Taekwondo Fight)
Description: A single-player, Street Fighter-style taekwondo match against an AI opponent.
Details:
Player Character (Evelyn):
Same structure as intro character (cylinder body, arms, legs, belt, sphere head).
Positioned on the left side of the screen at (x: -2, y: 0, z: 0).
Health: 100 points, displayed as a red THREE.PlaneGeometry(2, 0.2) bar above the character, shrinking as health decreases.
Opponent (Mystery Challenger):
Identical structure to Evelyn but with a red gi (0xff0000) and no belt.
Positioned on the right side at (x: 2, y: 0, z: 0).
Health: 100 points, with a red health bar above.
Controls:
Desktop:
Left Arrow: Move left (decrease x by 0.1 per frame, min x: -4).
Right Arrow: Move right (increase x by 0.1 per frame, max x: 0).
Up Arrow: Jump (increase y by 1 over 0.5 seconds, then fall back).
Spacebar: Attack (kick or punch, see mechanics).
Mobile:
On-screen buttons:
Left arrow (THREE.PlaneGeometry(0.5, 0.5)), gray, bottom-left corner.
Right arrow (THREE.PlaneGeometry(0.5, 0.5)), gray, next to left arrow.
Jump button (THREE.PlaneGeometry(0.5, 0.5)), yellow, bottom-center.
Attack button (THREE.PlaneGeometry(0.5, 0.5)), red, bottom-right.
Buttons use raycaster to detect taps.
Mechanics:
Moves:
Punch: Right arm rotates 30 degrees forward on X-axis over 0.3 seconds, then back. Deals 10 damage if within 1 unit of opponent.
Kick: Right leg rotates 45 degrees forward on X-axis over 0.5 seconds, then back. Deals 15 damage if within 1.5 units.
Spacebar alternates between punch and kick (first press: punch, second: kick, etc.).
Jump: Body moves up 1 unit, holds for 0.2 seconds, then falls back (gravity simulation).
AI Opponent:
Moves randomly left/right every 1-2 seconds (x += or -= 0.1).
Attacks every 2-3 seconds (randomly punch or kick).
Deals 10 damage if within 1 unit of player.
Collision: Use THREE.Box3 bounding boxes around characters to detect attack hits.
Win Condition: Reduce opponent’s health to 0.
Setting:
Floor: THREE.PlaneGeometry(10, 10) rotated 90 degrees on X-axis, colored light gray (0xd3d3d3) to mimic a mat.
Background: Solid dark blue (0x00008b) using scene.background.
Camera: THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000) positioned at (x: 0, y: 2, z: 5), looking at (0, 0, 0).
