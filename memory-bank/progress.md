# Progress: Evelyn's Taekwondo Showdown (Initialization)

## What Works

*   **Project Structure:** Basic file structure exists (`index.html`, `server.py`, assets).
*   **Memory Bank:** Core documentation files are being initialized.

## What's Left to Build (High Level)

*   **Core Game Logic:**
    *   Player character rendering.
    *   Input handling (keyboard).
    *   Movement implementation (left/right, jump).
    *   Attack implementation (kick).
    *   Sprite animation logic.
    *   Background rendering.
*   **Server Functionality:** Determine if `server.py` is needed beyond simple file serving. If so, implement required backend logic.
*   **Integration:** Connect frontend logic (`index.html`/JS) with any necessary backend components (`server.py`).

## Current Status

*   Project memory initialization is in progress.
*   No actual game functionality has been implemented or verified yet.
*   Existing code (`index.html`, `server.py`) has not been reviewed.

## Known Issues

*   None identified yet, as development hasn't started.

*(This file tracks the implementation status and outstanding work.)*
