# Product Context: Evelyn's Taekwondo Showdown

## Why This Project Exists

This project aims to create a fun, simple fighting game as a personal project or learning exercise, starring Evelyn.

## Problems It Solves

*   Provides a basic framework for a 2D fighting game.
*   Offers a platform to experiment with game development concepts (sprites, animation, controls).

## How It Should Work

*   The player controls Evelyn using keyboard inputs.
*   Evelyn can move left, right, jump, and perform a kick attack.
*   Animations should correspond to the actions performed.
*   The game takes place in a static environment defined by the background image.

## User Experience Goals

*   Simple and intuitive controls.
*   Visually clear feedback for player actions (animations).
*   A basic, engaging gameplay loop.
