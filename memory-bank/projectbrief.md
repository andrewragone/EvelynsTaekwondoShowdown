# Project Brief: Evelyn's Taekwondo Showdown

## Core Requirements & Goals

*   **Objective:** Create a simple 2D fighting game featuring Evelyn.
*   **Gameplay:** Basic movement (left/right), jumping, and kicking. Opponent AI is not initially required.
*   **Visuals:** Use the provided sprites for Evelyn and a background image.
*   **Technology:** To be determined (Initial files suggest Python backend and HTML/JS frontend).

## Scope

*   **Initial Focus:** Get a single character (Evelyn) controllable on screen with basic animations (standing, jumping, kicking) against a static background.
*   **Future Considerations:** Opponent character, health bars, scoring, sound effects, different stages.
