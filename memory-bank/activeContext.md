# Active Context: Evelyn's Taekwondo Showdown (Initialization)

## Current Work Focus

*   **Initializing Project Memory:** Creating the core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) and the `.clinerules` file.
*   **Understanding Initial State:** Analyzing the existing file structure (`index.html`, `server.py`, assets) to inform the initial Memory Bank documentation.

## Recent Changes

*   Created `projectbrief.md`.
*   Created `productContext.md`.
*   Created `systemPatterns.md`.
*   Created `techContext.md`.

## Next Steps

1.  Create `progress.md`.
2.  Create `.clinerules`.
3.  Begin inspecting existing code (`index.html`, `server.py`, `requirements.txt`) to verify assumptions and plan the implementation based on the `projectbrief.md`.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   The initial Memory Bank content is based on inferences from the file list. It will need refinement once the actual code is inspected.
*   The exact role of `server.py` (serving vs. logic) needs clarification.
*   The choice of JavaScript implementation (vanilla vs. library) is pending.
