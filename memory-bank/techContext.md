# Tech Context: Evelyn's Taekwondo Showdown

## Technologies Used (Inferred)

*   **Frontend:** HTML, potentially CSS and JavaScript (inferred from `index.html`). The specific JS libraries or frameworks are unknown.
*   **Backend/Server:** Python (inferred from `server.py` and `requirements.txt`). The specific Python framework (e.g., Flask, Django, or standard library http.server) is unknown.
*   **Assets:** PNG images for sprites, JPG for background, MP3 for audio.

## Development Setup (Assumed)

*   A Python environment is likely needed to run `server.py`. Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
*   A web browser is required to view and interact with `index.html`.
*   Code Editor: VS Code (based on environment details).

## Technical Constraints

*   Must run in a standard web browser.
*   Asset loading and performance might be considerations depending on the implementation complexity.

## Dependencies

*   **Python:** Specified in `requirements.txt`. Need to inspect this file to know the exact dependencies.
*   **JavaScript:** Unknown. Need to inspect `index.html` for `<script>` tags or linked JS files.
